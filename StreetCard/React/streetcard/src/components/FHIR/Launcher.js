// Launcher allows user to input options prior to launching the authorization 
flow. Here the user can "set up" what they want such as the scope, endpoint 
location, clientId. All these things options are referenced from config.json

Instead of referencing config.json, we would like to reference values stored 
in a Django database. 

We would get to this page AFTER a provider logs in

Instead of onChangeProvider, we want onChangePatient
